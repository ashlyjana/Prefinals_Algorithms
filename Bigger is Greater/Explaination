The program finds the next word that comes after the given word in alphabetical order. 
It looks at the word from the end to find where the order of letters changes, then swaps some letters to make a new word that is just a little bigger.
After swapping, it arranges the remaining letters in order to make it the smallest possible next word. If it cannot make a bigger word, it shows “no answer.”
