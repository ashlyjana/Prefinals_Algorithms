The program calculates how many squares a queen can attack on an n × n chessboard. 
It first lists all 8 directions the queen can move—up, down, left, right, and diagonals. 
Then, it stores all obstacles so the queen will stop before hitting them.
Starting from the queen’s position, the program moves step by step in each direction, checking if the new position is still inside the board and not blocked by an obstacle.
If the square is clear, it counts it as attackable and continues moving.
Once an obstacle or the board edge is reached, it switches to the next direction.
After checking all directions, it returns the total number of squares the queen can attack.
