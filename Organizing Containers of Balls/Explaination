The program checks if balls in containers can be rearranged so that each container holds only one type of ball. 
It first finds the total number of balls in each container (row sum) and the total number of each ball type (column sum). 
Then it sorts both lists and compares them. If every container’s capacity matches exactly one ball type’s total, it means we can rearrange the balls — so the output is “Possible”. 
If they don’t match, it means it can’t be done — so the output is “Impossible”.
